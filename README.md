# Shortest Path Visualization
This project aims to provide a visualization tool for the Dijkstra's algorithm, allowing users to interactively observe the process of finding the shortest path between two nodes on a grid. The visualization demonstrates the step-by-step traversal of nodes and highlights the nodes visited during the algorithm's execution.

# Features
- Interactive grid-based UI for selecting start and end nodes.
- Visualization of the Dijkstra's algorithm, animating the process of node traversal.
- Highlighting of the shortest path once it is found.
- Responsive and user-friendly design.
